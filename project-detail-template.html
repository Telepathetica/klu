      <h2>What it is</h2>
      <p>The Spotter app is a mobile-first interactive map that teaches you about local biodiversity while you wander around a coastal park. It‚Äôs part scavenger hunt, part field guide, part learning experiment. Built with Leaflet, some HTML/CSS/JS muscle, and a little love.</p>

      <h2>Why I made it</h2>
      <p>I wanted to combine mapping, data, and visual design into something playful and useful. Also, I like seaweed and forgot how fun it is to make things from scratch without waiting for approval from six departments.</p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>
      <p>The app runs entirely in-browser, no accounts or tracking. It pulls species data from a custom JSON file and filters it by location and time of day. Eventually, it‚Äôll get features like rarity badges, a ‚Äúspecies spotted‚Äù tracker, and maybe some gentle gamification.</p>

      <h2>What I learned</h2>
      <p>Leaflet is friendly. Designing for mobile while maintaining sanity is not. JSON structure planning matters more than you'd think. And people are unexpectedly thrilled to find out that limpets have teeth.</p>
