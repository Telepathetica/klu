    <h1>About This Place</h1>
    <p>A little cupboard of creative tech experiments</p>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p><strong>Stuff That Works</strong> is a casual collection of things I’ve built, designed, half-finished, accidentally fixed, or just got curious about. I’m not a guru, an influencer, or a lifestyle brand. I’m just good at making things work, eventually—sometimes the hard way.</p>

    <p>I’m a generalist: websites, SEO, databases, spreadsheets, animations, creative projects. If you’ve ever thought “there must be a clever way to do this,” that’s usually where I show up. Quietly. With coffee.</p>

    <h2>Why this site exists</h2>
    <p>I wanted somewhere to log my projects, experiments, and side quests—especially the ones that didn’t quite fit into any professional box. It’s also a place I can point people to when they ask, “What kind of things do you do?”</p>

    <p>It’s not a sales page. But if you like the way I think or want help with a creative, useful, slightly weird project—I might be up for it. Especially if it doesn’t involve too many meetings.</p>

    <h2>Things I enjoy</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Designing and building websites that don’t break</li>
      <li>Making animations that are slightly too ambitious</li>
      <li>Helping small businesses make sense of tech and marketing</li>
      <li>Playing with data, logic, and mild automation</li>
      <li>Exploring ideas that might be useless but fun</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Say hello</h2>
    <p>If you’re working on something and think I could help, <a href="mailto:hello@thecavs.com">drop me a line</a>. I don’t always take on projects, but I do like interesting conversations.</p>
